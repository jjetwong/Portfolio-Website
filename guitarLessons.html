        <h2> About Me</h2>
        <p id="aboutDesc">
            
            I've been playing guitar for more than a decade. Inspiration struck me as a child when AC/DC came roaring out of our car's speakers while on holiday. From that moment I was enamored with the power to create such strong feelings and I felt I'd love to make other people feel the exhiliration that music sparked in me.
            <br>
            <br>
            I received in-person lessons for 3 years which gave me the strong foundations that I could then build up from. After that I was granted a Music Scholarship at Kingsdale Foundation School where I would receive tuition once a week for the duration of my studies (5 years). After Sixth Form my musical tastes evolved into a wider array of genres including Neo-Soul, Delta Blues and others. I decided to take my Grade 8 Rockschool exam in 2019 as an academic challenge to myself and passed with a Merit soon after.  
            <br>
            <br>
            Now I feel like giving back and helping those who want to become proficient in guitar just like I've done but feel that I can make the journey easier from all the lessons I've learnt along the way.

        <h2> What you will be learning </h2>
        <p>

            If you were to take lessons with me, you would learn a wide range of skills and concepts related to playing the guitar. Some specific things you might learn include:
        </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Basic guitar technique, such as how to hold the guitar, how to strum and pick, and how to form chords</li>
                <li>Music theory fundamentals, such as how to read music notation and understand concepts like scales, intervals, and chord progressions</li>
                <li>A variety of musical styles and genres, including pop, fingerstyle, blues, rock, funk, jazz, metal...whatever you want!</li>
                <li>Techniques for playing lead guitar, such as how to play scales, arpeggios, and solos</li>
                <li>Techniques for fingerpicking and playing acoustic guitar</li>
                <li>Ways to practice effectively and improve your skills over time</li>
            </ul>
            
        <p>

            In addition to these technical skills, you would also learn how to express yourself musically through the guitar and use it as a means of self-expression and creativity. I would strive to create a supportive and encouraging learning environment that helps you reach your full potential as a guitar player.
